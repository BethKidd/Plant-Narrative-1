### Section 1: Introduction
Throughout the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the expansion of colonial rule in Hong Kong could be tracked along the treeline. British accounts of the pre-colonial landscape abound with assessments of bleak barrenness, of sun-scorched rocky topography divested of trees and life in general.  The land, increasingly inscribed with moralized ideals, was at best inhospitable and at worst ‘primitive.’  The self-identified task of the new government was to plant trees for multipronged effect, to cultivate shade and health in the dangerous tropical heat, and to temper the barren ‘wild’ of the indigenous landscape and move it steadily toward an ideal imported from the forested English countryside. Newly formed Agriculture and Forestry Departments approached this assignment voraciously, planting over a million trees a year for much of the twentieth century. Most of the species chosen to fill the rocky ridges were sourced from climatic neighbors like northeastern Australia, New Caledonia, and Papua New Guinea.  One such tree was the broad-leaf Paperbark species *Melaleuca quinquenervia* which can still be found lining streets in urban zones and filling wetland ecosystems.

### 
It is a similar tale of colonial [afforestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afforestation) that accounts for the broad-leaf paperbark’s status today as one of America’s most pernicious weeds. Early twentieth-century developers in South Florida repeat the rhetoric of a wasteland ripe with latent potential, one that could be unlocked with the aid of trees’ shade and fast-growing roots. For decades, *M. quinquenervia* was lauded as the tree that would dry up the Everglades, converting the putrid swamp into productive farmland. Departments of forestry subsidized its planting and cultivation, even broadcasting its seed from low-flying planes across acres of swamp. So highly prized was the paperbark for both its utility and ornamental value, early seed importers jostled to be recognized as its first American planter. A [memorial plaque in Lange Park,](https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/f7crBJDVxfJVFvPLAumHwA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2g9NzUwO3E9ODA7dz0xMDAw/https://s.yimg.com/bj/52ab/52abdf0d1887ac317a71dbbf16b3eea4.jpg) less than ten miles east of the Everglades, boasts John Lange’s Melaleuca of 1900 to be the oldest in the region. Towering over 25 meters prior to a lightning strike of 1990, it also came to be the tallest, for which it was awarded listed status as a so-called Champion Tree by the American Forestry Association of 1981.

### 
The broad-leaf paperbark of Lange Park is emblematic of the species’ swift and steep fall from grace: from 'Champion Tree' to incorrigible pest. 'This is a living monument that needs to die', insisted Broward County Environmental executive, Patti Webster, only a decade following its national honor. 'It's a tribute to what not to plant. [...] We'd be better off with a picture of it instead of the tree'. These later comments follow a series of laws passed in the 1990s designed to eliminate the species’ presence in southern Florida. Botanists increasingly concerned for its dominance in the Everglades now enlist terms of war to describe its reproduction. To Jonathan Silvertown, in his *Demons in Eden* (2005), the *M. quinquenervia* is part of an ‘army’ that ‘arrived with a vengeance and is advancing mercilessly across Florida's natural ecosystems’ at a current rate of [insert]. It is a villainous identity difficult to square with the paperbark’s long history as a treasure of aboriginal culture and bushcraft. How did this tree come to trace such a capricious path in its human alliances?

### Section 2: Colonial History, Naming, Morphology
The *Melaleuca quinquenervia* belongs to a genus of the Myrtle family, closely related to the Eucalyptus, and endemic to mainland Australia, New Caledonia, and Indonesia, its southern geographical limit reaching Botany Bay. As its common name suggests, these trees are distinctive for their bark, which easily peels from the truck in smooth, flat sheets. The *M. quinquenervia*, one of a group of up to 100 species described as ‘broadleaf’, can grow to heights of up to 20 meters. It favors riverbanks, swamps, floodplains, and estuaries. Its flowers, which appear in the fall, range from white to cream, and, characteristically of Melaleucas, comprise spiked clusters of petals from which it derives an additional common name: ‘bottle-brush tree’. Its leaves are dark, gray-green and oblong with five veins, as specified in the epithet 'quinquenervia'.

The Melaleuca genus was created in 1750 by Carl Linnaeus based on observations of specimens collected by the earlier German-born botanist Georg Eberhard Rumphius, famed as ‘the Pliny of the Indies’, found on expeditions in the Indonesian Maluku Islands during his employment for the Dutch East India Company in the late-seventeenth century. Rumphius’ botanical work, *Herbarium Amboinense* (1741) was published decades posthumously against all odds, despite the author’s acquired blindness in late life, the loss of his library to a fire, and the destruction of early copies in a shipwreck.

In the *Herbarium Amboinense*, a work from which Linnaeus was able to classify dozens of new genera, Rumphius describes a type of Myrtle tree, known in the native Malay as ‘Caju-puti’, to which he gives the Latin ‘Arbor alba’ (white tree) and Dutch ‘Witte Boom’. He also gives an additional synonym, ‘brant-boomen’ or ‘fire tree’, noting the apparent mystery that, though ‘no beast ever saw this tree burn, who paid the least attention’, and though often found in proximity to apparently untarnished trees, ‘the bottom of this trunk is always most black, as if it had been burnt’, suggesting to Rumphius that the heat of summer sun would scorch the dry and delicate bark without ever bursting into flame.

Rumphius’ account of the paperbark’s temporary visage following a bushfire, its white, flakey bark patchy under a scorched outer layer, is inscribed in the tree’s permanent name as given by Linnaeus, taken from the Greek mélas (black) and leukós (white). It remains a strong association for those familiar with the tree. In a recent [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrot_and_Olivier_in_America) of Australian novelist Peter Carey, a character disfigured by burns is pictured possessing ‘pale blue eyes’ which ‘peered out from his own tattered skin as if they were prisoners inside the trunk of a blackened antipodean paperbark’.

Further species of Melaleuca, including the *M. quinquenervia* of our focus here, became known to European botanical scholarship through the accounts and collections of Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander, a student of Linnaeus, who traveled to Botany Bay on Captain Cook’s HMS Endeavour between 1768 and 1771. The expedition returned to England with over 3,600 botanical specimens. Despite a significant financial investment from Banks of £7,000, the 2022 equivalent of $1,490,000, and 13 years of labor, the engravings were never published. A specimen of what is now understood to be the species quinquenervia, <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto=“0,1,2712,2622”>collected locally by Banks and Solander in 1770</span>, is preserved in the Queensland herbarium.

### Section 3: Paperbark in Australian/Oceanian Bushcraft and Indigenous Tradition
Attitudes toward the paperbark tree contrast sharply between American perspectives and the attitudes found among those living in the natural habitat of Melaleuca. For many of the Aboriginal tribes of Australia and the indigenous peoples of New Caledonia and Papua New Guinea, the paperbark tree holds a pivotal role in their cultures. In this corner of the world, people have used paperbark for everything from kindling to art.

### 
The tree has many uses that intersect with daily life, as a source of food, medicine, bedding, fuel, and protection from the elements. The bark can be easily peeled from the tree and used for shelter construction, fuelwood, wrapping food, lining earth ovens, bundling babies, and as an antiseptic bandage. The hardy trees also have environmental benefits, including soil conservation, windbreaking, erosion control, and provide habitats and sustenance for a multitude of organisms.

### 
M. quinquenervia has multiple medicinal applications. A tea brewed from young bruised leaves is drunk for headaches and general sickness. The leaf oil has been used to treat respiratory ailments, colds, and rheumatism and has antiseptic properties. Ironically in the U.S., M. quinquenervia has been labeled an allergen and respiratory irritant. Florida used this “fact” in the rationale for the 1990 ban on the sale, transportation, collection, cultivation, or possession of Melaleuca. Since the 1990s, studies have found M. quinquenervia is actually not a significant source of aeroallergen or a respiratory irritant. Like other Melaleuca species, M. quinquenervia produces a tea tree oil. This essential oil is used by many as an antibacterial, fungicide, and insect repellant, often intended to treat superficial skin conditions. However, modern producers derive commercially available tea tree oil from M. alternifolia, not M. quinquenervia. Commonly known as Niaouli, some sellers market the oil from the M. quinquenervia as having more robust properties than the more common tea tree oil.

For generations, the indigenous populations of Oceania have used Melaleuca bark to construct dwellings. Among some groups, dwelling building was completed entirely by women who cut the bark, built the structure, and even carried the components on their backs when traveling. Paperbark sheeting was stored when not used and sometimes transported as it is unavailable in some environments. Not only was paperbark significant for building a structure, but it had a further use as a bedding and lining material. These bark structures could range from open-air huts to more substantial structures intended to avoid the wet season's rains. The bark also provides insulation and a comfortable source of bedding. Ethnohistoric accounts describe Aboriginal Australians painting the interior of their dwellings with ochre. Australian oral history from the Wik-Mungkan people, an Aboriginal group from northern Queensland, includes a tale regarding the origins of paperbark dwellings. The story tells of a man and woman out foraging who, when caught by surprise by the fast-approaching rainy season, construct one of the first bark shelters. Using Melaleuca bark, the couple lined their house and stayed dry until the rainy season passed.

Aside from the bark, Melaleuca lumber is considered a suitable building material. The wood is hard and fine textured, naturally resistant to termite attacks, but tends to warp and is challenging to cut and season. In Florida, Melaleuca has been incorporated into fine-quality mulch. Craftspeople have used both the lumber and bark to fabricate boats and rafts. Additionally, Indigenous artisans use paperbark for to craft other vessels, such as liquid-holding containers and baskets.

###
Ethnographic accounts describe Aboriginal Australians using Melaleuca bark for lining earth ovens, wrapping food for cooking and storage, and fuelwood or kindling. More recently, Euro-Australians have also championed the culinary utility of the paperbark tree and Indigenous ingredients. Paperbark sheets intended for cooking are now commercially available. Chefs note food cooked while wrapped in paperbark takes on a smoky flavor and recommend the method for roasting fish, chicken, or vegetables. More than just the bark from Melaleuca has culinary applications. For example, seeping Melaleuca tree blossoms creates a natural sweetener, which has been used for candies. M. quinquenervia is a fine source of nectar and pollen for bees and is a significant source of honey in Australia and Florida, USA. The honey is described as having a rich caramel flavor and aroma.

###
Paperbark provided women with a genuinely utilitarian material. Melaleuca's oils repel insects and vermin, an ideal property for domestic concerns. Not only was Melaleuca ideal for building structures and cooking, but women incorporated the bark into birthing traditions and the early care of infants. In fact, for some Aboriginal Australians, childbirth occurred over a bark-lined pit, and then the newly born baby was wrapped in paperbark. Paperbark was also used to line the coolamon vessels for carrying babies.

###
Aboriginal Australians were born into paperbark, lived in paperbark, ate from paperbark, and used paperbark for everything from ritual crafts to repelling insects. Aboriginal Australians incorporate paperbark into every phase of life including funerary rituals. Humans have used paperbark for communicating, smoking, and transportation. It is no wonder that the paperbark tree lives on in the minds of contemporary Australians and serves as a symbol of Aboriginal resilience.

###
Aboriginal Australians so value paperbark that some have incorporated the tree into their names. The most famous of those is Oodgeroo Noonuccal (1920-1993), a Aboriginal Australian activist, educator, and artist. Noonuccal devoted her life to articulating the feelings of Aboriginal people and combating social inequality. Her writing explores themes of cultural identity, spirituality, place and time, simultaneously weaving in a rich description of Australia’s natural environment. Noonuccal advocated not only for Aboriginal Australians but for the environment. Her work draws attention to ecological symbiosis and the importance of the natural environment to Indigenous peoples and traditions.

title="Oodgeroo Noonuccal Reading Her Poems">

###
Formerly known as Kath Walker, in 1988, she adopted the name which translates to “paperbark tree of the Noonuccal,” crediting the group name of her ancestors. In the poem “Oodgeroo” which dates to the time of her name change, Noonuccal tells the story of a woman severed from her culture and people who, with the help of Biami the Good Spirit and the paperbark trees, spent many years recording lost tribal stories. The poem concludes with the woman’s adoption into a tribe of paperbark trees, with her old foe Time losing his power over her and the woman finding peace. In this poem, the utility of Melaleuca and Noonuccal’s feeling of kinship with the trees is evident.

### 
Militaristic analogies reenter the narrative of the Paperbark tree in discussions of control.  Attempts to push back the edges of *M. quinquenervia* groves are described in the language of battles and outright war between humans, accompanied by their army of emissaries, and. the ever encroaching, ever anthropomorphized enemy of the tree.  Tactics of control are aggressive and varied, including cutting, herbicides, burning, flooding, hand removal of individual saplings, and, increasingly, biological control.  A 1997 article in the *New York Times* speaks of a valiant ‘Army of Tree-Hungry Beetles’ ready for employment in the battle against the insidious Paperbark.  The text celebrates *Oxyops vitiosa*, a snout beetle also native to Eastern Australia, which was released in the late 1990s to colonize stands of the species in South Florida, in the hopes that the weevils, who feed primarily on the fresh leaves of saplings, would keep the further expansion of the tree at bay.  In the decades since their introduction, other insects like *Lophodiplosis trifida*, *Fergusonina turneri*, and others have been studying, and eventually released, for their possible usefulness in this ongoing ‘war.’  

### 
This framing of a human plant relationship as one of constant conflict and warfare is a relative constant in the field of invasion biology.  The label ‘invasive,’ as a scientific terms applied to an organism, has its mainstream origins in English zoologist, [Charles Elton's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sutherland_Elton) 1958 work, *The Ecology of Invasions by Animals and Plants*.  From that initial introduction of the terminology, the field existed in a state of relative dormancy until the mid to late 1990s, at which point publications on ‘invasives’ climbed percipitously.  In 1994, Hawai’i’s Senator Daniel Akaka spoke before Congress about the “slow, silent invasion of alien pests,” creeping across United States borders.  By 1999, the concepts and terminology had gained such traction that an executive order mandated the formation of the National Invasive Species Council, an inter-agency government coalition with the stated purpose of “safeguard[ing] the interests of the United States by preventing, eradicating, and controlling invasive species […]."
