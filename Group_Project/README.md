### Section 1: Introduction
Throughout the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the expansion of colonial rule in Hong Kong could be tracked along the treeline. British accounts of the pre-colonial landscape abound with assessments of bleak barrenness, of sun-scorched rocky topography divested of trees and life in general.  The land, increasingly inscribed with moralized ideals, was at best inhospitable and at worst ‘primitive.’  The self-identified task of the new government was to plant trees for multipronged effect, to cultivate shade and health in the dangerous tropical heat, and to temper the barren ‘wild’ of the indigenous landscape and move it steadily toward an ideal imported from the forested English countryside. Newly formed Agriculture and Forestry Departments approached this assignment voraciously, planting over a million trees a year for much of the twentieth century. Most of the species chosen to fill the rocky ridges were sourced from climatic neighbors like northeastern Australia, New Caledonia, and Papua New Guinea.  One such tree was the broad-leaf Paperbark species Melaleuca quinquenervia which can still be found lining streets in urban zones and filling wetland ecosystems.

### 
A similar colonial propensity for afforestation haunts further histories of Paperbark’s spread.  The accounts of early twentieth century developers in South Florida share in the rhetoric of a wasteland ripe with latent potential, one that could be unlocked with the aid of trees’ shade and fast-growing roots.  For decades, M. quinquenervia was lauded as the tree that would dry up the Everglades, converting the putrid swamp into productive farmland. Departments of forestry subsidized its planting and cultivation, even broadcasting its seed from low-flying planes across acres of swamp. So highly prized was the paperbark for both its utility and ornamental value, early seed importers jostled to be recognized as its first American planter. A memorial plaque in Lange Park, less than ten miles east of the Everglades, boasts John Lange’s Melaleuca of 1900 to be the oldest in the region. Towering 83 feet prior to a lightning strike of 1990, it also came to be the tallest, for which it was awarded listed status as a so-called ‘champion tree’ by the American Forestry Association of 1981.

The Melaleuca’s fall from grace has been swift and steep—though not universal. It remains a treasured species by indigenous and settler Australians alike, its uses and cultural significance predating these colonial projects by many thousands of years [how many??]. Meanwhile, botanists increasingly concerned for the species’ dominance in the Everglades now enlist terms of war to describe its reproduction. To Jonathan Silvertown, in his Demons in Eden (2005), the M. quinquinervia is part of an ‘army’ that ‘arrived with a vengeance and is advancing mercilessly across Florida's natural ecosystems’. Laws have emerged since the 1990s in effort to eliminate its presence. Not even the prized Melaleuca of Lange park is exempt from ill will: “This is a living monument that needs to die”, insisted Broward County Environmental executive, Patti Webster. “It's a tribute to what not to plant. [...] We'd be better off with a picture of it instead of the tree".

What follows is an attempt to account for how the paperbark, from its ancient use to modern scourge, came to trace such a capricious path in its human alliances. What qualities have secured its favor? What conditions have aggravated its ‘faults’?

### Section 6: Conclusion 
The exotic tree Melaleuca quinquenervia (Cav.) Blake (commonly referred to as Melaleuca or paperbark tree) aggressively invades many south Florida ecosystems (Fig. 1), including the Everglades (Hofstetter, 1991; Bodle et al., 1994). It was introduced during the early 1900s or late 1800s (Gifford, 1937; Meskimen, 1962; Dray, pers. comm.). Melaleuca quinquenervia displaces native vegetation, degrades wildlife habitat, creates fire hazards, and causes human health problems (Morton, 1962; Diamond et al., 1991). Florida state laws enacted in 1990 and 1993 prohibit the sale, cultivation, and transportation of M. quinquenervia. It was placed on the United States Department of Agriculture’s Federal Noxious Weed List in 1992 (Bodle et al., 1994; Laroche, 1994).
